# Burger

This app demonstrates the use of Node.js, Express.js, MySQL and Handlebars in creating a CRUD application. Devour-a-Burger lets users create burgers and log when they are devoured. When a user creates a burger the burger's name is stored in a database. The name of the burger is displayed using a call to the database along with an option to devour the burgers. Devoured burgers are displayed to the user.

Burger is deployed to Heroku.
